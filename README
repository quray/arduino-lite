Welcome to use Litelib for Arduino-Lite, the light-weight and efficient arduino-variant runtime library for AVR based devices.

This library is orignally used by RoboPeak team (www.robopeak.com) and we are proud of releasing it to the public.

---------------------------
  First Use:
---------------------------
If it is the first time for this lib to run on the machine (checked-out from the SVN, extracted from the downloaded package file), please following these:
  
  a. make sure the current platform is supported (see Support Platforms)
  c. execute the batch file: buildenv.cmd
     This script will extract the WinAVR automatically and configure the working envirnoment.
  b. you are ready to use Arduino-Lite

---------------------------
  Supported Platforms:
---------------------------
The source code shoud work on all platforms (Linux, MacOS, Win32) but the build system only supports Win32 currently.

We had verified the following Windows versions:
<> Windows XP 32bit
<> Windows Vista 32bit and 64bit
<> Windows 7 32bit and 64bit

---------------------------
  Create New Project
---------------------------
Arduino-Lite Project can be created via the template file under <Arduino-lite home>/sketch/template.zip

To create your own project:
1) extract the template.zip under the folder <Arduino-lite home>/sketch
2) make sure the extracted folder is like the following:
    <Arduino-lite home>/sketch/template/build.cmd
3) rename the dir template to any name you like, e.g. helloAVR
4) You have done.

---------------------------
  Compile a Project
---------------------------
1) enter the project folder (e.g. helloAVR), execute the batch file launchsh.cmd
2) type make
3) If there is no error during the building phase, you will get the hex/elf file under <project_folder>/build/

---------------------------
  Documents?
---------------------------
The project homepage on google code contains most avaliable doucments for Arduino-Lite.

Besides, you may check RoboPeak website(http://www.robopeak.com) for additional tips. (some articles may written in Chinese only)

As Arduino-Lite are similar to the offical Arduino library, you will find most function calls are alike. So the offical Arduino referece document is helpful.


---------------------------
  Avaliable Make Commands
---------------------------
<> make/make all
   build the current project
<> make clean
   clean the previous build result
<> make upload
   update the hex to the AVR chip (via STK500v2 bootloader)
<> make dump
   disassembly the generated binary (*.elf) to AVR assembly code
<> make dumpobj
   disassembly each generated object file (*.o) to AVR assembly code
