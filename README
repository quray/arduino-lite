Welcome to use Arduino-Lite, the light-weight and efficient arduino-variant runtime library for AVR based devices.

Arduino-Lite is based on the work of Arduino Project: www.arduino.cc

This library is orignally used by RoboPeak team (www.robopeak.com) and we are proud of releasing it to the public.

---------------------------
  First Use:
---------------------------
If it is the first time for this lib to run on the machine (checked-out from the SVN, extracted from the downloaded package file), please follow these steps:
  
  a. make sure the current platform is supported (see Support Platforms)
  c. execute the batch file: buildenv.cmd under the source root
     This script will extract the WinAVR automatically and configure the working envirnoment.
  b. you are ready to use Arduino-Lite after the script exit

Arduino-Lite is self-contained, which means you don't need to install/download any extra software/lib before (Yes, Arduino-lite also includes WINAVR for you). 
  
---------------------------
  Supported Platforms:
---------------------------
The source code shoud work on all platforms (Linux, MacOS, Win32) but the build system only supports Win32 currently.

We had verified the following Windows versions:
<> Windows XP 32bit
<> Windows Vista 32bit and 64bit
<> Windows 7 32bit and 64bit

---------------------------
  Create New Project
---------------------------
Arduino-Lite Project can be created via the template file under <Arduino-lite home>/sketch/template.zip

To create your own project:
1) extract the template.zip under the folder <Arduino-lite home>/sketch
2) make sure the extracted folder is like the following:
    <Arduino-lite home>/sketch/template/build.cmd
3) rename the dir template to any name you like, e.g. helloAVR
4) You have done.

---------------------------
  Compile a Project
---------------------------
1) enter the project folder (e.g. helloAVR), execute the batch file launchsh.cmd
2) type make <enter>
3) If there is no error during the building phase, you will get the hex/elf file under <project_folder>/build/

Besides, you may check RoboPeak website(http://www.robopeak.com) for additional tips. (some articles may written in Chinese only)

As Arduino-Lite are similar to the offical Arduino library, you will find most function calls are alike. So the offical Arduino referece document is helpful.
